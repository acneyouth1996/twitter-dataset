I sent my mom the new @paulg essay to see what she thought. My family really cared about grades, sent me to Kaplan to get better scores on the SAT, &amp; had me do those extra curriculars. So, I was curious what she'd think. The part about her growing up in Inidia was interesting. https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1203268525198127109
