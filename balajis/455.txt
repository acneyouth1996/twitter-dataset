Thanks for the correction. I would have thought social distancing would have defeated the point of Tinder and Grindr (eg: https://swipelife.tinder.com/tag/social-distancing). Clubs, bars, etc also down. But you're right, the app is being used differently, but it's all digital substitutes now. Will update.
