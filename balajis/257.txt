Wonderful work. Thanks for writing this, especially when so ill. Couldn’t have been easy. It will have an impact, as relatively few survivors have gotten their stories out. We need data on people’s self reports of illness severity. Not just death stats. https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1259213752601178113?s=21
